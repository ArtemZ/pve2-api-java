=============

Proxmox API Client for Java

*Will be upgraded to work for Proxmox 4.0, features that we don't need will be removed for simplicity*.

Planned features:

* Getting VMs with their Disks and Network Interfaces
* Creating new VMs
* Deleting VMs
* Starting (normal or network boot) and Stopping of VMs
* Changing the IP and MAC Address of Network Interfaces
* Changing the core characteristics of VMs (CPU, RAM, HDD size...)
* Maybe more...
